# JuliaPractice
The best way to learn a programming language is to start working with it. One good way to master Julia is to start implementing some famous algorithms using Julia. This project implements the following algorithms:

- Merge Sort
- Binary Search

## Warning
This project is not to showcase the best possible way to implement the above algorithms in Julia. This is just an outcome of my own learning process. Even if I later learn a better way to implement the same, I may not have time to come back and improve this implementation.
